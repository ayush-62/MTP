# Scalable-SMT-Attack

ARF_testcases:- ARF Test cases code with TAO Break only.

Mod-AES:- Modified AES code locked only in Mixcolum-AddRoundKey function. Only sub-part of the code optimization applied.

Modified_AES325:- Modified AES code, locked applied everywhere. All the optimizations are applied.

AES:- uses the code of original AES. All optimization applied.

ARF:- Attacks on ARF test cases.

RSA:- All the attacks done on RSA benchmarks.

Array:- Two example, one with array optimization and one without array optimization.

Motion:- Experiment Done on motion.
